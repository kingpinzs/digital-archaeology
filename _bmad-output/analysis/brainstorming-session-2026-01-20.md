# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Jeremy
**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Ideas Generated:** 56

---

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Complete, immersive "engineer your own CPU history" learning experience

**Goals:**
1. No gaps - every concept from first principles to superscalar covered
2. Deep "why" understanding at every historical branch point
3. Freedom to choose differently and see consequences
4. Hands-on implementation validates understanding

**Core Test:** "Could I have invented this myself if I understood the problem?"

**Mode:** Decision-maker + Builder (both thinking AND doing)

---

## The Vision: Digital Archaeology

You're not building "a CPU learning project."

You're building a **time-machine simulator for computer architecture** where you:

1. **Get plopped into the mind** of historical discoverers
2. **Face the same constraints** they faced (technical, economic, political)
3. **Make YOUR decision** at each branch point
4. **See what history chose** and why
5. **Identify the traps** - where backward compatibility / greed / "good enough" locked in suboptimal solutions
6. **Explore the roads not taken** - what would computing look like if someone had been brave at the right moment?
7. **Create YOUR OWN paths** - ideas that aren't in history at all

## Key Branch Points in History

| Era | Branch Point | What Happened | Road Not Taken |
|-----|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1837 | Babbage's Engine | Funding pulled | What if it was built? |
| 1970s | 4004 → 8008 → 8080 | Accumulator → register file | Stack machines (Burroughs) |
| 1978 | 8086 addressing | Segment registers (hack) | Flat 32-bit from start? |
| 1980s | IBM PC architecture | Open-ish standard, clones | Proprietary (Apple route) |
| 1985 | 386 protected mode | Keep real mode compatibility | Clean break? |
| 1990s | RISC vs CISC | x86 won via brute force | What if MIPS/SPARC won? |
| 2000s | Multicore pivot | Cores instead of GHz | Something else entirely? |

## "Things Left on the Floor" - To Investigate

| Abandoned Idea | Why It Died | Could It Work? |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Relay computers** | Slow, bulky | But ANYONE can build one. Zero fab required. |
| **Analog computing** | Noise, precision | But neural networks are analog-ish. Revival? |
| **Ternary logic** | Transistors favor binary | But optical/quantum might not. Future? |
| **Stack machines** | Register machines won | But JVM/WebAssembly are stack-based. Comeback? |
| **Dataflow architectures** | Control flow won | But GPUs are kinda dataflow. Hidden in plain sight? |
| **Lisp machines** | General purpose won | But specialized AI hardware is hot now. Same pattern? |
| **Transport-Triggered (TTA)** | Weird, hard to program | Radically simpler. What if we embraced weirdness? |
| **Asynchronous CPUs** | Global clock was easier | No clock = less power, no timing attacks |

---

## The Endgame

**The ultimate deliverable isn't a CPU.**

**It's a complete, buildable, teachable path from "I know nothing" to "I built a computer and I understand every atom of it" - using only things any person can obtain without permission from monopolies.**

### For the Learner

| What They Get | How |
|---------------|-----|
| **Ownership** | YOUR ideas matter. Not just following a script. |
| **Deep Understanding** | Dead ends teach WHY. Not just "wrong" but "wrong because..." |
| **Connection** | Your thinking links to the web of human discovery |
| **Freedom** | Explore anything. Return anytime. No wrong path. |
| **Real Learning** | The struggle, the building, the discovery - it's YOURS |

### The Ultimate Test

> "Can I build a complete computer - from switches to operating system - using ONLY things I could make or source without billion-dollar dependencies?"

---

## Next Steps

1. Map these ideas onto the existing project structure (Micro4 → Micro8 → Micro16 → etc.)
2. Define Stage 0 (pre-CPU fundamentals) curriculum
3. Create the "golden path" timeline from BC to modern CPU
4. Design the branch/exploration system
5. Build the first "discoverer's mind" experience as a prototype
6. Identify safe real-world experiments for each stage
7. Create the kit designs for physical builds

---

## Session Insights

**Key Breakthrough:** The project isn't about teaching CPUs - it's about creating an immersive time-travel simulation where learners BECOME the discoverers and make their own choices.

**Critical Reframe:** The user journey doesn't start at "4-bit CPU" - it starts at "you don't know computers exist." The learner gets plopped into historical minds, starting from whoever first noticed electricity.

**Unique Value:** Dead ends are as educational as successes. The system shows WHY things fail (physics, economics, timing, materials), which teaches deeper than just showing what works.

**The Structure:** Golden path (real history) + Your branches (your ideas) + New paths (your inventions). Like Assassin's Creed's Animus - jump between timelines, follow curiosity, always able to return.
