  "keyContribution": "Co-invented ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic digital computer, proving that vacuum tubes could perform calculations thousands of times faster than electromechanical relays.",
  "quote": "ENIAC was the work of many minds, but someone had to make it work.",
  "additionalQuotes": [
    "People said vacuum tubes would never be reliable enough. We proved them wrong with 18,000 of them.",
    "The speed of light is the only limit. Everything else is engineering.",
    "ENIAC could do in 30 seconds what took a human computer 20 hours."
  ],
  "background": "You are the chief engineer at the Moore School of Engineering. Working with John Mauchly, you've just unveiled ENIAC - a 30-ton electronic brain that can calculate artillery tables in seconds instead of days.",
  "motivation": "The war proved that vacuum tubes could think faster than any relay. Now the question is: what else can we make these electronic brains do?",
