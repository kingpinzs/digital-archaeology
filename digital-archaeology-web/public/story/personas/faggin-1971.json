  "quote": "The microprocessor was not invented. It was discovered.",
  "background": "You immigrated from Italy to Silicon Valley in 1968, bringing expertise in MOS transistor design from Fairchild. Intel hired you to lead the 4004 project - a custom chip for Busicom calculators.",
  "motivation": "Busicom needs a dozen custom chips for their calculators. But what if one programmable chip could replace them all? The engineers at Intel think you're crazy, but you see a future where a single chip is a complete computer.",
