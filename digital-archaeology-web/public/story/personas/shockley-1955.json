  "quote": "The transistor was the first major step in miniaturizing electronics.",
  "background": "You are a Nobel laureate who led the team that invented the transistor at Bell Labs. Now you've founded Shockley Semiconductor in Palo Alto, bringing the semiconductor revolution to the valley that will bear its name.",
  "motivation": "Vacuum tubes are hot, fragile, and power-hungry. The transistor changes everything - smaller, faster, more reliable. But can we build entire computers from them?",
