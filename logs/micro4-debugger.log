All tasks completed. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Created files:**
- `src/micro4/debugger.h` - Header with Debugger struct and function declarations
- `src/micro4/debugger.c` - Full implementation with interactive command loop

**Modified files:**
- `src/micro4/Makefile` - Updated to build `micro4-dbg` alongside `micro4`

**Debugger features implemented:**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `step`, `s` | Execute one instruction |
| `run`, `r` | Run until halt or breakpoint |
| `break <addr>`, `b` | Set breakpoint at hex address |
| `clear <addr>`, `c` | Clear breakpoint |
| `list`, `l` | List all breakpoints |
| `regs`, `d` | Show register state |
| `mem <start> [end]` | Dump memory range |
| `load <file>` | Load and assemble program |
| `reset` | Reset CPU (keep memory) |
| `help`, `h`, `?` | Show commands |
| `quit`, `q` | Exit debugger |

**Usage:**
```bash
./micro4-dbg program.asm  # Load and debug a program
./micro4-dbg              # Start without a program, use 'load' command
```

The commit `d9b73f0` has been created on the `feature/micro4-debugger` branch.
