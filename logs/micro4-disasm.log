Done. Here's a summary of what I created:

## Summary

**Created `src/micro4/disasm.c`** - A standalone disassembler with:
- **Input formats**: Binary files (raw bytes) and hex dump files
- **Output**: Formatted assembly with addresses and comments
- **Label generation**: Automatically identifies jump targets (JMP/JZ) and creates labels
- **Instruction handling**: Correctly handles 1-byte instructions (HLT, LDI) and 2-byte instructions (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, JMP, JZ)
- **Command-line options**:
  - `-x` - Hex input mode
  - `-c` - Show instruction comments
  - `-a` - Show addresses and hex bytes
  - `-l` - Suppress label generation
  - `-r <addr>` - Start at specific address
  - `-s <count>` - Limit bytes to disassemble

**Updated `src/micro4/Makefile`** to:
- Build the disassembler alongside the emulator
- Add `make disasm` and `make micro4` targets
- Update clean, install, and help targets

**Commit**: `7e0fbef` on branch `feature/micro4-disasm`

Note: Build testing wasn't possible as no C compiler is available in this environment, but the code follows the same patterns as the existing codebase and should compile cleanly with `make`.
