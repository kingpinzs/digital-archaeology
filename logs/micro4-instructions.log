I've completed all the tasks. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

Added 8 new instructions to complete the Micro4 CPU instruction set (opcodes 0x8-0xF):

| Opcode | Mnemonic | Description | Format |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 0x8 | AND | A = A & mem[addr] | 2-byte (with address) |
| 0x9 | OR | A = A \| mem[addr] | 2-byte (with address) |
| 0xA | XOR | A = A ^ mem[addr] | 2-byte (with address) |
| 0xB | NOT | A = ~A | 1-byte |
| 0xC | SHL | A = A << 1 | 1-byte |
| 0xD | SHR | A = A >> 1 | 1-byte |
| 0xE | INC | A = A + 1 | 1-byte |
| 0xF | DEC | A = A - 1 | 1-byte |

**Files modified:**
- `src/micro4/cpu.h` - Added opcode definitions
- `src/micro4/cpu.c` - Implemented instructions in `cpu_step()`, updated `OPCODE_NAMES` and `cpu_disassemble()`
- `src/micro4/assembler.c` - Added assembler support for new mnemonics

**Files created:**
- `programs/bitwise_test.asm` - Test program that exercises all new instructions

All instructions properly update the zero flag and mask results to 4 bits. The commit has been made to the `feature/micro4-instructions` branch.
