Done. I've created `docs/micro8_isa.md` with a comprehensive ISA specification for the Micro8 CPU. The document includes:

**Architecture:**
- 8 x 8-bit general-purpose registers (R0-R7) with aliases (A, B, C, D, E, H, L)
- Register pairs (BC, DE, HL) for 16-bit operations
- 16-bit PC and SP, flags register (Z, C, S, O)
- 64KB address space with zero page, stack area, and interrupt vector

**Instruction Set (~80 instructions):**
- Data movement (18): MOV, LD, ST, PUSH, POP, etc.
- Arithmetic (16): ADD, SUB, INC, DEC, CMP, NEG, 16-bit operations
- Logic (12): AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts, rotates
- Control flow (18): JMP, JR, conditional branches, CALL, RET
- Stack (6): PUSH/POP for registers and pairs
- System (10): NOP, HLT, EI, DI, IN, OUT, flag manipulation

**Addressing Modes (8):** Implicit, register, immediate, direct, zero page, indirect [HL], indexed [HL+d], relative

**Educational elements:**
- Explains *why* each feature was added (limitations table)
- Block diagrams and visual memory maps
- 6 example programs with machine code
- Interrupt handling flow diagram
- Comparison table with Micro4
- Full opcode map in appendix

The commit is on branch `feature/micro8-isa`.
