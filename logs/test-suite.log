Done! I've created 5 new test programs for the Micro4 CPU emulator:

| Program | Purpose | Result |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **divide.asm** | Integer division via repeated subtraction | 9 / 3 = 3 |
| **factorial.asm** | Factorial with nested multiplication loop | 3! = 6 |
| **bubble_sort.asm** | Sort 3 elements [5,2,8] → [2,5,8] | Smallest = 2 |
| **gcd.asm** | GCD using Euclidean subtraction method | GCD(6,4) = 2 |
| **negative.asm** | Tests underflow, overflow, zero flag | All tests pass (0xF) |

All programs follow the established style with:
- Comments explaining the algorithm
- ORG directives for code and data sections
- Expected results documented
- Proper label naming conventions

The commit has been made on the `feature/test-suite` branch.
